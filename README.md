## About Me

Hi! I'm a 2nd year PhD student in the [Audio Signal Processing team](https://www.aalto.fi/en/department-of-signal-processing-and-acoustics) at Aalto University. My research is centered on artificial reverberation, using delay-line-based reverb and machine learning optimization. Hope to see you at DAFx24!

Here you'll find some of my projects related to audio signal processing and more. Feel free to explore, fork, and contribute! 
I'm always open to collaboration, discussing ideas, or chatting about any of my passions. Reach out if you want to connect! 


#### Things I love to do while not doing research

- 🏃🏼‍♀️‍➡️ I’m an avid runner, training to stay in shape while gathering the courage to sign up for my next marathon.
- 🎧 Passionate about electronic music. I'm involved with the [entropy](https://entropy.fi) collective and [IDARADIO](https://idaidaida.net). Feel free to check out my mixes and tracks on [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/jiaozifan).
