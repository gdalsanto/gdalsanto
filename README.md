Hi! I'm a 3rd-year PhD student in the [Audio Signal Processing team](https://www.aalto.fi/en/department-of-signal-processing-and-acoustics) at Aalto University. My research is centered on artificial reverberation, using delay-line-based reverb and machine learning optimization.

Here you'll find some of my projects related to artificial reverb, and ASP. Feel free to explore, fork, and contribute:)

I'm always open to collaboration, discussing ideas, or chatting about any of my passions. Reach out if you want to connect! 


#### Things I love to do while I'm not doing research

- 🏃🏼‍♀️‍➡️ I’m an avid runner, training to stay in shape while gathering the courage to sign up for my next marathon.
- 🎧 I'm passionate about electronic music. I'm involved with the [entropy](https://entropy.fi) collective and former co-producer at [IDARADIO](https://idaidaida.net). Feel free to check out my mixes and tracks on [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/controfaces).
